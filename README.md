| **[EMTSF:Extraordinary Mixture of SOTA Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23396v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The immense success of the Transformer architecture in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown. However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid, by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixing It Up: Exploring Mixer Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11816v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) has recently emerged as a distinct research field, necessitating specialized models to address its unique challenges. While most forecasting literature assumes regularly spaced observations without missing values, many real-world datasets - particularly in healthcare, climate research, and biomechanics - violate these assumptions. Time Series (TS)-mixer models have achieved remarkable success in regular multivariate time series forecasting. However, they remain unexplored for IMTS due to their requirement for complete and evenly spaced observations. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMTS-Mixer, a novel forecasting architecture designed specifically for IMTS. Our approach retains the core principles of TS mixer models while introducing innovative methods to transform IMTS into fixed-size matrix representations, enabling their seamless integration with mixer modules. We evaluate IMTS-Mixer on a benchmark of four real-world datasets from various domains. Our results demonstrate that IMTS-Mixer establishes a new state-of-the-art in forecasting accuracy while also improving computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Interpretable Evaluation Measures for Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23261v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring. While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited. Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index), that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are inaccessible with traditional measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightKooba: A Fast Interpretable FTP Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19885v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory prediction (FTP) and similar time series tasks typically require capturing smooth latent dynamics hidden within noisy signals. However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Major revision of the manuscript to refine the narrative, clarify the model's theoretical limitations and application scope, and improve overall presentation for journal submission</p></details> |
| **[Factor-guided estimation of large covariance matrix function with conditional functional sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02450v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the fundamental task of estimating covariance matrix functions for high-dimensional functional data/functional time series. We consider two functional factor structures encompassing either functional factors with scalar loadings or scalar factors with functional loadings, and postulate functional sparsity on the covariance of idiosyncratic errors after taking out the common unobserved factors. To facilitate estimation, we rely on the spiked matrix model and its functional generalization, and derive some novel asymptotic identifiability results, based on which we develop DIGIT and FPOET estimators under two functional factor models, respectively. Both estimators involve performing associated eigenanalysis to estimate the covariance of common components, followed by adaptive functional thresholding applied to the residual covariance. We also develop functional information criteria for model selection with theoretical guarantees. The convergence rates of involved estimated quantities are respectively established for DIGIT and FPOET estimators. Numerical studies including extensive simulations and a real data application on functional portfolio allocation are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is the accepted version by Journal of Econometrics and includes the supplementary material of the paper</p></details> |
| **[A time warping model for seasonal data with application to age estimation from narwhal tusks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05843v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signals with varying periodicity frequently appear in real-world phenomena, necessitating the development of efficient modelling techniques to map the measured nonlinear timeline to linear time. Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Transformer: Attention Over Finite Memories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations and sensitive event detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A method for outlier detection based on cluster analysis and visual expert criteria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23136v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas. Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.</p></details> |  |
| **[IKNet: Interpretable Stock Price Prediction via Keyword-Guided Integration of News and Technical Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07661v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets. Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Task-Agnostic Fusion of Time Series and Imagery for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23118v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAP4TS: A Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework for Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23090v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23060v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and statistical consistency of the detection tests, allowing regulators to temporally verify alarm correctness without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftTS: A Swift Selection Framework for Time Series Pre-trained Models via Multi-task Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23051v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks. However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model selection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Time Series: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13868v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series frequently manifest distribution shifts, diverse latent features, and non-stationary learning dynamics, particularly in open and evolving environments. These characteristics pose significant challenges for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While substantial progress has been made, a systematic synthesis of advancements remains lacking. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive review of OOD generalization methodologies for time series, organized to delineate the field's evolutionary trajectory and contemporary research landscape. We organize our analysis across three foundational dimensions: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For each dimension, we present several popular algorithms in detail. Furthermore, we highlight key application scenarios, emphasizing their real-world impact. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and propose future research directions. A detailed summary of the methods reviewed for the generalization of OOD in time series can be accessed at https://tsood-generalization.com.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Weighted compositional functional data analysis for modeling and forecasting life-table death counts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22988v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Age-specific life-table death counts observed over time are examples of densities. Non-negativity and summability are constraints that sometimes require modifications of standard linear statistical methods. The centered log-ratio transformation presents a mapping from a constrained to a less constrained space. With a time series of densities, forecasts are more relevant to the recent data than the data from the distant past. We introduce a weighted compositional functional data analysis for modeling and forecasting life-table death counts. Our extension assigns higher weights to more recent data and provides a modeling scheme easily adapted for constraints. We illustrate our method using age-specific Swedish life-table death counts from 1751 to 2020. Compared to their unweighted counterparts, the weighted compositional data analytic method improves short-term point and interval forecast accuracies. The improved forecast accuracy could help actuaries improve the pricing of annuities and setting of reserves.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Not All Data are Good Labels: On the Self-supervised Labeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14704v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is a crucial task in various domains, yet existing TSF models rely heavily on high-quality data and insufficiently exploit all available data. This paper explores a novel self-supervised approach to re-label time series datasets by inherently constructing candidate datasets. During the optimization of a simple reconstruction network, intermediates are used as pseudo labels in a self-supervised paradigm, improving generalization for any predictor. We introduce the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally, we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance of various backbone models. This work offers a new perspective on constructing datasets and enhancing the generalization of TSF models through self-supervised learning. The code is available at https://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/SCAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS'25 (spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Diffuse to Detect: A Generalizable Framework for Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models Applications to UAVs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22928v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying regression-based and design-based causal inference in time-series experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22864v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series experiments, also called switchback experiments or N-of-1 trials, play increasingly important roles in modern applications in medical and industrial areas. Under the potential outcomes framework, recent research has studied time-series experiments from the design-based perspective, relying solely on the randomness in the design to drive the statistical inference. Focusing on simpler statistical methods, we examine the design-based properties of regression-based methods for estimating treatment effects in time-series experiments. We demonstrate that the treatment effects of interest can be consistently estimated using ordinary least squares with an appropriately specified working model and transformed regressors. Our analysis allows for estimating a diverging number of treatment effects simultaneously, and establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of the regression-based estimators. Additionally, we show that asymptotically, the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance estimators provide conservative estimates of the true, design-based variances. Importantly, although our approach relies on regression, our design-based framework allows for misspecification of the regression model.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[Efficiently Learning Synthetic Control Models for High-dimensional Disaggregated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22828v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Synthetic Control method (SC) has become a valuable tool for estimating causal effects. Originally designed for single-treated unit scenarios, it has recently found applications in high-dimensional disaggregated settings with multiple treated units. However, challenges in practical implementation and computational efficiency arise in such scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Multivariate Square-root Lasso method into the synthetic control framework. We rigorously establish the estimation error bounds for fitting the Synthetic Control weights using Multivariate Square-root Lasso, accommodating high-dimensionality and time series dependencies. Additionally, we quantify the estimation error for the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our method offers superior computational efficiency without compromising estimation accuracy. We apply our method to assess the causal impact of COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders on the monthly unemployment rate in the United States at the county level.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Theory of the Mechanics of Information: Generalization Through Measurement of Uncertainty (Learning is Measuring)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22809v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty, the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making, offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.</p></details> | 117 pages |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Big Data</p></details> |
| **[FARS: Factor Augmented Regression Scenarios in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10679v4)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of macroeconomic/financial time series, the FARS package provides a comprehensive framework in R for the construction of conditional densities of the variable of interest based on the factor-augmented quantile regressions (FA-QRs) methodology, with the factors extracted from multi-level dynamic factor models (ML-DFMs) with potential overlapping group-specific factors. Furthermore, the package also allows the construction of measures of risk as well as modeling and designing economic scenarios based on the conditional densities. In particular, the package enables users to: (i) extract global and group-specific factors using a flexible multi-level factor structure; (ii) compute asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings; (iii) obtain estimates of the parameters of the FA-QRs together with their standard deviations; (iv) recover full predictive conditional densities from estimated quantiles; (v) obtain risk measures based on extreme quantiles of the conditional densities; and (vi) estimate the conditional density and the corresponding extreme quantiles when the factors are stressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Atlas Urban Index: A VLM-Based Approach for Spatially and Temporally Calibrated Urban Development Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22702v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ab...</summary><p>An abridged version of this paper will be presented at and appear in the Proceedings of ACM IKDD CODS 2025</p></details> |
| **[TABL-ABM: A Hybrid Framework for Synthetic LOB Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22685v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent application of deep learning models to financial trading has heightened the need for high fidelity financial time series data. This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the Workshop on AI in Finance at ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Inference on common trends in functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00590v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study statistical inference on unit roots and cointegration for time series in a Hilbert space. We develop statistical inference on the number of common stochastic trends embedded in the time series, i.e., the dimension of the nonstationary subspace. We also consider tests of hypotheses on the nonstationary and stationary subspaces themselves. The Hilbert space can be of an arbitrarily large dimension, and our methods remain asymptotically valid even when the time series of interest takes values in a subspace of possibly unknown dimension. This has wide applicability in practice; for example, to cointegrated vector time series that are either high-dimensional or of finite dimension, to high-dimensional factor models that include a finite number of nonstationary factors, to cointegrated curve-valued (or function-valued) time series, and to nonstationary dynamic functional factor models. We include two empirical illustrations to the term structure of interest rates and labor market indices, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Without Augmenting: Unsupervised Time Series Representation Learning via Frame Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22655v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

| **[CLEANet: Robust and Efficient Anomaly Detection in Contaminated Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22619v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its strong generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on Subject 07-Brownie, the study investigates the entire processing pipeline, from data alignment and transformation to fusion method evaluation, interpretability, and modality contribution. A unified preprocessing pipeline is developed to temporally align heterogeneous video and audio data. Fusion is performed through resampling, grayscale conversion, segmentation, and feature standardization. Semantic richness is confirmed via heatmaps, spectrograms, and luminance time series, while frame-aligned waveform overlays demonstrate temporal consistency. Results indicate that late fusion yields the highest validation accuracy, followed by hybrid fusion, with early fusion performing the lowest. To assess the interpretability and discriminative power of audio and video in fused activity recognition, PCA and t-SNE visualize feature coherence over time. Classification results show limited performance for audio alone, moderate for video, and significant improvement with multimodal fusion, underscoring the strengths of combined data. Incorporating RFID data, which captures sparse interactions asynchronously, further enhances recognition accuracy by over 50% and improves macro-averaged ROC-AUC. The framework demonstrates the potential to transform raw, asynchronous sensor data into aligned, semantically meaningful representations, providing a reproducible approach for multimodal data integration and interpretation in intelligent systems designed to perceive complex human activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NetBurst: Event-Centric Forecasting of Bursty, Intermittent Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22397v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting on widely used benchmark time series data (e.g., ETT, Electricity, Taxi, and Exchange Rate, etc.) has favored smooth, seasonal series, but network telemetry time series -- traffic measurements at service, IP, or subnet granularity -- are instead highly bursty and intermittent, with heavy-tailed bursts and highly variable inactive periods. These properties place the latter in the statistical regimes made famous and popularized more than 20 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. Yet forecasting such time series with modern-day AI architectures remains underexplored. We introduce NetBurst, an event-centric framework that reformulates forecasting as predicting when bursts occur and how large they are, using quantile-based codebooks and dual autoregressors. Across large-scale sets of production network telemetry time series and compared to strong baselines, such as Chronos, NetBurst reduces Mean Average Scaled Error (MASE) by 13--605x on service-level time series while preserving burstiness and producing embeddings that cluster 5x more cleanly than Chronos. In effect, our work highlights the benefits that modern AI can reap from leveraging Mandelbrot's pioneering studies for forecasting in bursty, intermittent, and heavy-tailed regimes, where its operational value for high-stakes decision making is of paramount interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring State Transitions in Markovian Systems with Sampling Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22327v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models (TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TimeXL: Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow-prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement-continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Gradient-based Causal Discovery Framework with Applications to Complex Industrial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11178v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification: A Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth's orbital satellite population grows exponentially, effective space situational awareness becomes critical for collision prevention and sustainable operations. Current approaches to monitor satellite behaviors rely on expert knowledge and rule-based systems that scale poorly. Among essential monitoring tasks, satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification, analyzing behaviors like station-keeping maneuvers and drift operations, remains underdeveloped due to aerospace system complexity, operational variability, and inconsistent ephemerides sources. We propose a novel generative approach for satellite PoL identification that significantly eliminates the dependence on expert knowledge. The proposed approach leverages orbital elements and positional data to enable automatic pattern discovery directly from observations. Our implementation uses a diffusion model framework for end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain expertise. The architecture combines a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data with a conditional denoising process to generate accurate PoL classifications. Through experiments across diverse real-world satellite operational scenarios, our approach demonstrates superior identification quality and robustness across varying data quality characteristics. A case study using actual satellite data confirms the approach's transformative potential for operational behavior pattern identification, enhanced tracking, and space situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapeX: Shapelet-Driven Post Hoc Explanations for Time Series Classification Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20084v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p></details> |  |

While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement. Our code is available on GitHub, and the datasets and trained models are available on Hugging Face.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the Thirty-ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

We characterize the behavior of affine time-invariant systems via kernel, input-output, state-space, and finite-horizon data-driven representations, demonstrating a range of structural parallels with linear time-invariant systems. Building on these representations, we introduce a new persistence of excitation condition tailored to the model class of affine time-invariant systems. The condition yields a new fundamental lemma that parallels the classical result for linear systems while provably reducing data requirements. Our analysis highlights that excitation conditions must be adapted to the model class: overlooking structural differences may lead to unnecessarily conservative data requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

Forecasting the probability distribution of peak demand on shorter timescales is a critical forward-facing issue under increasing volatility. This study introduces a novel ensemble-based machine learning method for peak demand probability density forecasting that extends classical extreme value theory to model time series peaks as nonstationary statistical distributions. The approach employs an ensemble of tree-based learners that recursively partition the covariate space and estimate local generalized extreme value distributions, allowing it to automatically capture complex covariate-dependent parameter variations. Unlike existing approaches, which often suffer from convergence issues or restrictive functional forms, this framework is both flexible and robust. Validation on a case study based on the PJM interconnection demonstrates that the method achieves a 38 percent reduction in committed capacity when generation is scheduled based on a reliability criterion. These improvements provide practical value for power system operation, enabling risk-aware capacity scheduling under peak demand uncertainty and supporting reliability-driven decision making in future energy systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completed major revision</p></details> |
| **[TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09114v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |

It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. The core idea of this work is inspired by the foundation studies, \textit{The Power of Quantum Neural Networks} by Amira Abbas \textit{et al.} and \textit{Quantum Vision Transformers} by El Amine Cherrat \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{ Nature Computational Science} (2021) and \textit{Quantum} (2024), respectively. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results on two different datasets display that the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss. These results indicate the prospect of using quantum computing to boost deep learning architectures in complex machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Fourier Transform versus Discrete Chi-Square Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting many signals superimposed on an unknown trend. The solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfils the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability.The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. If the Gauss-Markov theorem is valid, DCM can not fail. We recommend fast sampling of large high quality datasets and the analysis of those datasets using numerical DCM parallel computation Python code.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

We study out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics, suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |

However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment.

Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh-Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4D and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh-Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This research introduces a novel methodology for time series forecasting that combines Ensemble technique with a Direct Multi-Step (DMS) forecasting procedure. This Ensembled Direct Multi-Step (EDMS) approach not only leverages the strengths of both techniques but also capitalizes on their synergy. The ensemble models in the methodology were selected based on performance, complexity, and computational resource requirements, encompassing a full spectrum of model complexities, from simple Linear and Polynomial Regression to medium-complexity ETS and complex LSTM model. Models were weighted based on their performances. In the DMS procedure we limit retraining to one- and five- year/month forecasts for economic and financial data respectively. Standard Iterative Multi-Step (IMS) procedure is employed for other horizons, effectively reducing computational demands while maintaining satisfactory results. The proposed methodology is benchmarked against Ensemble technique conventionally applied to IMS-generated forecasts, utilizing several publicly available macroeconomic and financial datasets. Results demonstrate a significant performance improvement with EDMS methodology, averaging a 33.32% enhancement across the analysed datasets, and sometimes improvement reaching above 60%.</p></details> | 39 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast reconciliation with non-linear constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21249v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for forecasting time series adhering to linear constraints have seen notable development in recent years, especially with the advent of forecast reconciliation. This paper extends forecast reconciliation to the open question of non-linearly constrained time series. Non-linear constraints can emerge with variables that are formed as ratios such as mortality rates and unemployment rates. On the methodological side, Non-linearly Constrained Reconciliation (NLCR) is proposed. This algorithm adjusts forecasts that fail to meet non-linear constraints, in a way that ensures the new forecasts meet the constraints. The NLCR method is a projection onto a non-linear surface, formulated as a constrained optimisation problem. On the theoretical side, optimisation methods are again used, this time to derive sufficient conditions for when the NLCR methodology is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy. Finally on the empirical side, NLCR is applied to two datasets from demography and economics and shown to significantly improve forecast accuracy relative to relevant benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Token-level Topological Structures in Transformer-based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10337v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting (TSF) by capturing positional and semantic topological relationships among input tokens. However, it remains unclear whether existing Transformers fully leverage the intrinsic topological structure among tokens throughout intermediate layers. Through empirical and theoretical analyses, we identify that current Transformer architectures progressively degrade the original positional and semantic topology of input tokens as the network deepens, thus limiting forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that explicitly enforcing preservation of these topological structures within intermediate layers can tighten generalization bounds, leading to improved forecasting performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Topology Enhancement Method (TEM), a novel Transformer-based TSF method that explicitly and adaptively preserves token-level topology. TEM consists of two core modules: 1) the Positional Topology Enhancement Module (PTEM), which injects learnable positional constraints to explicitly retain original positional topology; 2) the Semantic Topology Enhancement Module (STEM), which incorporates a learnable similarity matrix to preserve original semantic topology. To determine optimal injection weights adaptively, TEM employs a bi-level optimization strategy. The proposed TEM is a plug-and-play method that can be integrated with existing Transformer-based TSF methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating TEM with a variety of existing methods significantly improves their predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of explicitly preserving original token-level topology. Our code is publicly available at: \href{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/TEM}{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/TEM}.</p></details> |  |

This paper reformulates a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, as a time-series segmentation task suited for SNN execution. Automated systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram encoding methods and network parameters, applying first and second-order leaky integrate and fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. We introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, improving detection performance across multiple encodings strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling initial results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). We position SNNs as a viable path towards real-time RFI detection, with many possibilities for follow-up studies. These findings highlight the potential for SNNs performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way towards efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Shylock: Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series based on Hybrid Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21181v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience, statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner platform</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTime: Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting Powered by Vision Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) possesses great practical values in various fields, including power and energy, transportation, etc. TSF methods have been studied based on knowledge from classical statistics to modern deep learning. Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have long been known to be problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. Practitioners expect a TSF foundation model that serves TSF tasks in different applications. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers one pioneering study in the TSF foundation model development method and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. ViTime fundamentally shifts TSF from numerical fitting to operations based on a binary image-based time series metric space and naturally supports both point and probabilistic forecasting. We also provide rigorous theoretical analyses of ViTime, including quantization-induced system error bounds and principled strategies for optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, we propose RealTS, an innovative synthesis algorithm generating diverse and realistic training samples, effectively enriching the training data and significantly enhancing model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's state-of-the-art performance. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15\%. With just 10\% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both leading foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks, a gap that widens with 100\% fine-tuning. ViTime also exhibits exceptional robustness, effectively handling missing data and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30\% under various data perturbations, validating the power of its visual space data operation paradigm.</p></details> |  |

As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd edition of the Workshop in AI and Finance at ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[Autocorrelation Test under Frequent Mean Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21047v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing for the presence of autocorrelation is a fundamental problem in time series analysis. Classical methods such as the Box-Pierce test rely on the assumption of stationarity, necessitating the removal of non-stationary components such as trends or shifts in the mean prior to application. However, this is not always practical, particularly when the mean structure is complex, such as being piecewise constant with frequent shifts. In this work, we propose a new inferential framework for autocorrelation in time series data under frequent mean shifts. In particular, we introduce a Shift-Immune Portmanteau (SIP) test that reliably tests for autocorrelation and is robust against mean shifts. We illustrate an application of our method to nanopore sequencing data.</p></details> |  |

Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation} (iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label scarcity in time series across the physical sciences.

| **[Exploring Spiking Neural Networks for Binary Classification in Multivariate Time Series at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20997v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness. To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency. We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 27 figures |

To achieve this, M2VN combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture.

| **[Flow based approach for Dynamic Temporal Causal models with non-Gaussian or Heteroscedastic Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17065v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non-stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be nonGaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non-stationary processes along with non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log-likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non-stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[xTime: Extreme Event Prediction with Hierarchical Knowledge Distillation and Expert Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20651v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare, these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme events improving from 3% to 78%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical neural architecture search approach for time series forecasting tasks. With the design of a hierarchical search space, we incorporate many architecture types designed for forecasting tasks and allow for the efficient combination of different forecasting architecture modules. Results on long-term-time-series-forecasting tasks show that our approach can search for lightweight high-performing forecasting architectures across different forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Random Process Complexity Ranking Using a Bound on Conditional Differential Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20551v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future observations given past context. However, its direct computation for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable. This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices. To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to recover the known complexity ordering. This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models, that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Neural CDEs (NCDEs) treat time series data as observations from a control path, parameterise a CDE's vector field using a neural network, and use the solution path as a continuously evolving hidden state. As their formulation makes them robust to irregular sampling rates, NCDEs are a powerful approach for modelling real-world data. Building on neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), we introduce Log-NCDEs, a novel, effective, and efficient method for training NCDEs. The core component of Log-NCDEs is the Log-ODE method, a tool from the study of rough paths for approximating a CDE's solution. Log-NCDEs are shown to outperform NCDEs, NRDEs, the linear recurrent unit, S5, and MAMBA on a range of multivariate time series datasets with up to $50{,}000$ observations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into future production systems.</p></details> |  |

However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20383v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.</p></details> |  |

Channel-independent methods such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations, while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention. We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and 2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the number of variables increases.</p></details> | 23pages, 3 figures |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Time-series Forecasting with Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02844v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynTSBench: Rethinking Temporal Pattern Learning in Deep Learning Models for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20273v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities, which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities; and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types of temporal features.The code is available at https://github.com/TanQitai/SynTSBench</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing graph-based spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs. We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms, filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions. Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707% improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31% market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent population states, termed compartmental prototypes. It discovers a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from surveillance data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE combines self-supervised pre-training objectives with lightweight epidemic-aware regularizers that align the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases and 50+ regions, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded.</p></details> | version 2.0_fixed |
| **[AssistedDS: Benchmarking How External Domain Knowledge Assists LLMs in Automated Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13992v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

| **[DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks.

| **[Speculative Sampling for Parametric Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20031v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential, limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.</p></details> |  |

Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Abstain Mask Retain Core: Time Series Prediction by Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19980v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations) during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient and robust forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures.

To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05960v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |

Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.</p></details> |  |

A 64-element Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MaMIMO) array was used to capture channels for three trajectories of an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV), including two horizontal zig-zag flights at fixed altitudes and one vertical ascent, chosen to emulate AUE operations and to induce controlled azimuth and elevation sweeps for analyzing geometry-dependent propagation dynamics. We examine large-scale power variations and their correlation with geometric features, such as elevation, azimuth, and 3D distance, followed by an analysis of fading behavior through distribution fitting and Rician K-factor estimation. Furthermore, temporal non-stationarity is quantified using the Correlation Matrix Distance (CMD), and angular stationarity spans are utilized to demonstrate how channel characteristics change with the movement of the UAV. We also analyze Spectral Efficiency (SE) in relation to K-factor and Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread, highlighting their combined influence on link performance. The results show that the elevation angle is the strongest predictor of the received power, with a correlation of more than 0.77 for each trajectory, while the Nakagami model best fits the small-scale fading. The K-factor increases from approximately 5 dB at low altitudes to over 15 dB at higher elevations, indicating stronger LoS dominance. Non-stationarity patterns are highly trajectory- and geometry-dependent, with azimuth most affected in horizontal flights and elevation during vertical flight. These findings offer valuable insights for modeling and improving UAV communication channels in 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (IEEE TVT)</p></details> |

Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force, velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation, yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback, and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication in IEEE</p></details> |

The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor, the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design. This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition. Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the uncertain task sizes and high mobility of UAVs pose great challenges to guarantee the quality of service. To address these issues, we propose an LAN architecture where UAVs and HAPs collaboratively provide computation offloading for ground users. Moreover, the uncertainty sets are constructed to characterize the uncertain task size, and a distributionally robust optimization problem is formulated to minimize the worst-case delay by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions and UAV trajectories. To solve the mixed-integer min-max optimization problem, we design the distributionally robust computation offloading and trajectories optimization algorithm. Specifically, the original problem is figured out by iteratively solving the outerlayer and inner-layer problems. The convex outer-layer problem with probability distributions is solved by the optimization toolkit. As for the inner-layer mixed-integer problem, we employ the Benders decomposition. The decoupled master problem concerning the binary offloading decisions is solved by the integer solver, and UAV trajectories in the sub-problem are optimized via the successive convex approximation. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional optimization methods in balancing the worst-case delay and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limits of Generative Pre-Training in Structured EMR Trajectories with Irregular Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22878v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete. Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical probe before fine-tuning or deployment.</p></details> |  |

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we address the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems with unknown dynamics. We propose a hierarchical planning framework that enables zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks by leveraging only task-agnostic trajectory data during offline training. The framework consists of three key components: (i) decomposing the STL specification into several progresses and time constraints, (ii) searching for timed waypoints that satisfy all progresses under time constraints, and (iii) generating trajectory segments using a pre-trained diffusion model and stitching them into complete trajectories. We formally prove that our method guarantees STL satisfaction, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating dynamically feasible trajectories across diverse long-horizon STL tasks.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by some recent works that have proposed effective algorithms, based on Polyak's heavy ball method and the Nesterov accelerated gradient method, to achieve convergence to a local minimum of nonconvex functions, this work proposes a broad class of Nesterov-type accelerated methods and puts forth a rigorous study of these methods encompassing the escape from saddle points and convergence to local minima through both an asymptotic and a non-asymptotic analysis. In the asymptotic regime, this paper answers an open question of whether Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) with variable momentum parameter avoids strict saddle points almost surely. This work also develops two metrics of asymptotic rates of convergence and divergence, and evaluates these two metrics for several popular standard accelerated methods such as the NAG and Nesterov's accelerated gradient with constant momentum (NCM) near strict saddle points. In the non-asymptotic regime, this work provides an analysis that leads to the "linear" exit time estimates from strict saddle neighborhoods for trajectories of these accelerated methods as well the necessary conditions for the existence of such trajectories. Finally, this work studies a sub-class of accelerated methods that can converge in convex neighborhoods of nonconvex functions with a near optimal rate to a local minimum and at the same time this sub-class offers superior saddle-escape behavior compared to that of NAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>122 p...</summary><p>122 pages, 20 figures; accepted for publication in Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGATFormer: A Graph-Based Transformer Approach for Worker and Obstacle Trajectory Prediction in Off-site Construction Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22205v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns, they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions. TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3 m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m). Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRASE-NODEs: Trajectory Sensitivity-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Efficient Dynamic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22104v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling dynamical systems is crucial across the science and engineering fields for accurate prediction, control, and decision-making. Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, particularly neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), have emerged as a powerful tool for data-driven modeling of continuous-time dynamics. Nevertheless, standard NODEs require a large number of data samples to remain consistent under varying control inputs, posing challenges to generate sufficient simulated data and ensure the safety of control design. To address this gap, we propose trajectory-sensitivity-aware (TRASE-)NODEs, which construct an augmented system for both state and sensitivity, enabling simultaneous learning of their dynamics. This formulation allows the adjoint method to update gradients in a memory-efficient manner and ensures that control-input effects are captured in the learned dynamics. We evaluate TRASE-NODEs using damped oscillator and inverter-based resources (IBRs). The results show that TRASE-NODEs generalize better from the limited training data, yielding lower prediction errors than standard NODEs for both examples. The proposed framework offers a data-efficient, control-oriented modeling approach suitable for dynamic systems that require accurate trajectory sensitivity prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Minimum Threat Exposure using Physics-Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17762v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |

The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our system</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures and 3 tables.

However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. In addition, our framework can successfully adapt to and improve reasoning datasets represented by AIME-2024. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a work in progress due to methodology refinement and further evaluation</p></details> |

Simulation offers scalability but suffers from sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning. Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

| **[Blur2seq: Blind Deblurring and Camera Trajectory Estimation from a Single Camera Motion-blurred Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20539v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

| **[Simultaneous Stiffness and Trajectory Optimization for Energy Minimization of Pick-and-Place Tasks of SEA-Actuated Parallel Kinematic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20490v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed. These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two (parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The results confirm the validity of this approach.</p></details> |  |

This approach is beneficial if it is easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines. The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree, which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Hybrid Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22894v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid dynamical systems pose significant challenges for effective planning and control, especially when additional constraints such as obstacle avoidance, state boundaries, and actuation limits are present. In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding, enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20% validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6 with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60 language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate, reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment, derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</p></details> |  |

The optimization problem is posed in the likeness of a multiple-shooting approach, aiming for segment-to-segment continuity while tracking proximity to the original CR3BP structures. The analysis of various formulations leads to the selection of an unconstrained least-squares problem for further investigation. The nonlinear optimization problem is convexified and the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as an alternative to the minimum-norm update equation found in most literature, is investigated for its control over the update step and inherent robustness. Additional techniques such as adaptive weighting are employed to further consolidate the behavior of the proposed algorithm in challenging scenarios. Numerical trials evaluate the adequacy of the methodology presented and compare it to the minimum-norm baseline over various application cases, including the generation of quasi-periodic trajectories and orbital transfers between them. The proposed approach is found to outperform the baseline in applications where the initial guess is poor and the ease of including proximity constraints provides benefits in control over the shape of the converged solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Advances in Space Research</p></details> |

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

In stochastic models every simulation is run with a specific parameter set and an implicit or explicit random seed, where each parameter set and random seed combination generates an individual realization, or trajectory, sampled from an underlying random process. Existing BO approaches typically rely on summary statistics over the realizations, such as means, medians, or quantiles, potentially limiting their effectiveness when trajectory-level information is desired. We propose a trajectory-oriented Bayesian optimization method that incorporates a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate using both input parameters and random seeds as inputs, enabling direct inference at the trajectory level. Using a common random number (CRN) approach, we define a surrogate-based likelihood over trajectories and introduce an adaptive Thompson Sampling algorithm that refines a fixed-size input grid through likelihood-based filtering and Metropolis-Hastings-based densification. This approach concentrates computation on statistically promising regions of the input space while balancing exploration and exploitation. We apply the method to stochastic epidemic models, a simple compartmental and a more computationally demanding agent-based model, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency and faster identification of data-consistent trajectories relative to parameter-only inference.</p></details> |  |

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Distributed Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Optimization for Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle Swarm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17541v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

| **[KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs better than simpler representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,3 figures, Iberian Robotics Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Variance-Reduction Guidance: Sampling Trajectory Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21792v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}. The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models.

Trajectory samplers rely on control input samplers, which generate control inputs u from a distribution p(u | x) where x is the current state. We introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii) in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI. Experiments show that CFU-MPPI outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate in challenging navigation tasks in cluttered polygonal environments while requiring a much smaller sampling budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results.

| **[Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16376v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[SPOT: Sensing-augmented Trajectory Planning via Obstacle Threat Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16308v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UAVs equipped with a single depth camera encounter significant challenges in dynamic obstacle avoidance due to limited field of view and inevitable blind spots. While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT (Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed) and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations, significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot systems in real-world applications.

This study presents a Transformer-based framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision (AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold.

| **[TGT: Text-Grounded Trajectories for Locally Controlled Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15104v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings, offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Simulation results show safe trajectories through complex environments can be generated in milliseconds that cover tens of meters.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT.

However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence.

The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

The dense waypoint graph is condensed using probabilistic quantum-annealing to preserve interference-aware centroids while reducing the control state space and maintaining link-quality. The resulting problem is formulated as a priority-aware Markov decision process and solved using epsilon-greedy off-policy Q-learning, considering UAV kinematic and flight corridor constraints. Unlike complex continuous-action reinforcement learning approaches, GC-QAP achieves stable convergence and low outage with substantially and lower computational cost compared to baseline schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMNet: Leveraging Cooperative Awareness Messages for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12703v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |
| **[Few Shot Semi-Supervised Learning for Abnormal Stop Detection from Sparse GPS Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12686v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods. The code and dataset are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Abnormal-Stop-Detection-SSL.git}</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[HiCoTraj:Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12067v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs' zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output. This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Generative and Agentic AI for Multi-Modality Space-Time Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Trajectory control of a suspended load with non-stopping flying carriers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11413v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first closed-loop control framework for cooperative payload transportation with non-stopping flying carriers. Building upon grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adap-RPF: Adaptive Trajectory Sampling for Robot Person Following in Dynamic Crowded Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11308v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction, enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments. Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://adap-rpf.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Controllable Generative Trajectory Prediction via Weak Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10731v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents' summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health Workshop</p></details> |

This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.</p></details> | 5 figures |
| **[Sample-Efficient Online Learning in LM Agents via Hindsight Trajectory Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10304v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10140v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</p></details> |  |

While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.</p></details> |  |

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MICCAI 2025 Learning with Longitudinal Medical Images and Data Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Opt: Scalable Centralized Multi-Robot Trajectory Optimization with Flow Matching and Differentiable Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09204v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization. Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture different collision-avoidance behaviors.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC), we develop trajectories that optimize both the traversal of speed bumps and overall passenger comfort. A key contribution of this work is the formulation of speed bump handling constraints that closely emulate human driving behavior, seamlessly integrating these with broader road navigation requirements. Through extensive simulations in varied urban driving environments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its ability to ensure smooth speed transitions over speed bumps while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment. The method's capability to handle both static road features and dynamic constraints, alongside expert human driving, represents a significant step forward in trajectory planning for urban</p></details> |  |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/FlexTraj</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.</p></details> |  |

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm, software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.</p></details> |  |

This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

However, environmental perturbations or execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution. We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure.

| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19223v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at NeurIPS 2025 D&B track</p></details> |

This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Dual Prompting: Hierarchical Debiasing for Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23469v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks, they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer, reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Predictions of Molecular Properties with Graph Featurisation and Heterogeneous Ensemble Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23428v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML) models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular descriptors. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP. The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Lingual Sponsored Search via Dual-Encoder and Graph Neural Networks for Context-Aware Query Translation in Advertising Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22957v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual sponsored search is crucial for global advertising platforms, where users from different language backgrounds interact with multilingual ads. Traditional machine translation methods often fail to capture query-specific contextual cues, leading to semantic ambiguities that negatively impact click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR). To address this challenge, we propose AdGraphTrans, a novel dual-encoder framework enhanced with graph neural networks (GNNs) for context-aware query translation in advertising. Specifically, user queries and ad contents are independently encoded using multilingual Transformer-based encoders (mBERT/XLM-R), and contextual relations-such as co-clicked ads, user search sessions, and query-ad co-occurrence-are modeled as a heterogeneous graph. A graph attention network (GAT) is then applied to refine embeddings by leveraging semantic and behavioral context. These embeddings are aligned via contrastive learning to reduce translation ambiguity. Experiments conducted on a cross-lingual sponsored search dataset collected from Google Ads and Amazon Ads (EN-ZH, EN-ES, EN-FR pairs) demonstrate that AdGraphTrans significantly improves query translation quality, achieving a BLEU score of 38.9 and semantic similarity (cosine score) of 0.83, outperforming strong baselines such as mBERT and M2M-100. Moreover, in downstream ad retrieval tasks, AdGraphTrans yields +4.67% CTR and +1.72% CVR improvements over baseline methods. These results confirm that incorporating graph-based contextual signals with dual-encoder translation provides a robust solution for enhancing cross-lingual sponsored search in advertising platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR-Mamba: Geometry-to-Tangent Routing for Hyperbolic POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22942v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing. GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM), enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, submitted to ICDE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Diffuse to Detect: A Generalizable Framework for Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models Applications to UAVs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22928v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastJAM: a Fast Joint Alignment Model for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22842v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds.

| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

While prevailing defense strategies focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs, on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability, offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks. Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations, with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness. We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum, average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

While widely successful, this approach is well known to suffer from the over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena, which result in representational collapse as the number of layers increases and insensitivity to the information contained at distant and poorly connected nodes, respectively. In this paper, we present a unified view of these problems through the lens of vanishing gradients, using ideas from linear control theory for our analysis. We propose an interpretation of GNNs as recurrent models and empirically demonstrate that a simple state-space formulation of a GNN effectively alleviates over-smoothing and over-squashing at no extra trainable parameter cost. Further, we show theoretically and empirically that (i) GNNs are by design prone to extreme gradient vanishing even after a few layers; (ii) Over-smoothing is directly related to the mechanism causing vanishing gradients; (iii) Over-squashing is most easily alleviated by a combination of graph rewiring and vanishing gradient mitigation. We believe our work will help bridge the gap between the recurrent and graph neural network literature and will unlock the design of new deep and performant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22555v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant malicious triggers to manipulate model predictions. Existing trigger generators are often simplistic in structure and overly reliant on specific features, confining them to a single graph learning paradigm, such as graph supervised learning, graph contrastive learning, or graph prompt learning. This specialized design, which aligns the trigger with one learning objective, results in poor transferability when applied to other learning paradigms. For instance, triggers generated for the graph supervised learning paradigm perform poorly when tested within graph contrastive learning or graph prompt learning environments. Furthermore, these simple generators often fail to utilize complex structural information or node diversity within the graph data. These constraints limit the attack success rates of such methods in general testing scenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, we propose Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers(CP-GBA), a new transferable graph backdoor attack that employs graph prompt learning(GPL) to train a set of universal subgraph triggers. First, we distill a compact yet expressive trigger set from target graphs, which is structured as a queryable repository, by jointly enforcing class-awareness, feature richness, and structural fidelity. Second, we conduct the first exploration of the theoretical transferability of GPL to train these triggers under prompt-based objectives, enabling effective generalization to diverse and unseen test-time paradigms. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and defense scenarios show that CP-GBA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iteratively Refined Early Interaction Alignment for Subgraph Matching based Graph Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22538v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network (GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments, and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/structlearning/isonetpp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01436v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in finding the best graph neural network architecture on a given graph dataset. However, existing GNAS methods still require intensive human labor and rich domain knowledge when designing the search space and search strategy. To this end, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into GNAS and present a new GNAS model based on LLMs (GNAS-LLM for short). The basic idea of GNAS-LLM is to design a new class of GNAS prompts for LLMs to guide LLMs towards understanding the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running LLMs with the prompts, GNAS-LLM generates more accurate graph neural network architectures with fast convergence. Experimental results show that GNAS-LLM outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods on four benchmark graph datasets, with an average improvement of 0.7% on the validation sets and 0.3% on the test sets. Besides, GNAS-LLM achieves an average improvement of 1.0% on the test sets based on the search space from AutoGEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Robust Signed Graph Learning through Joint Input-Target Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22513v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties, graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation, RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |

As a common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of *topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph** **T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on multiple node classification datasets.

In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

The development of open-source models in chemistry has specifically surfaced dual-use concerns around toxicological data and chemical warfare agents. We discuss a chain risk framework identifying three misuse pathways and corresponding mitigation strategies: inference-level, model-level, and data-level. At the data level, we introduce a model-agnostic noising method to increase prediction error in specific desired regions (sensitive regions). Our results show that selective noise induces variance and attenuation bias, whereas simply omitting sensitive data fails to prevent extrapolation. These findings hold for both molecular feature multilayer perceptrons and graph neural networks. Thus, noising molecular structures can enable open sharing of potential dual-use molecular data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Augmentation: Leveraging Inter-Instance Relation in Self-Supervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22322v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism.

| **[Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328v4)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce high-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Data-Driven Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22096v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs. Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves 0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in preclinical and clinical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time, and model size across different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-LSE Method for Fast, Robust, and Physically-Consistent AC Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22020v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust, iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR. The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution, while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for real-time operations and analysis.</p></details> |  |

DPEB is a curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings), contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling. Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.</p></details> |  |

We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv (HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction. Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a 3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting performance on complex, real-world graph data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HollowFlow: Efficient Sample Likelihood Evaluation using Hollow Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21542v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce $\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$ speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational bottlenecks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |

MAGNET serves as a comprehensive solution for training a variety of GNN models, integrating deep learning and other advanced algorithms such as METIS and k-means to facilitate mesh agglomeration and quality metric computation. The library's introduction is outlined through its code structure and primary features. The GNN framework adopts a graph bisection methodology that capitalizes on connectivity and geometric mesh information via SAGE convolutional layers, in line with the methodology proposed by Antonietti et al. (2024). Additionally, the proposed MAGNET library incorporates reinforcement learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model for predicting coarse partitions within a multilevel framework. A detailed tutorial is provided to guide the user through the process of mesh agglomeration and the training of a GNN bisection model. We present several examples of mesh agglomeration conducted by MAGNET, demonstrating the library's applicability across various scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced models is contrasted with that of METIS and k-means, illustrating that the proposed GNN models are competitive regarding partition quality and computational efficiency. Finally, we exhibit the versatility of MAGNET's interface through its integration with Lymph, an open-source library implementing discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids for the numerical discretization of multiphysics differential problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects in Networks using Domain Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21457v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training. This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pilot Contamination-Aware Graph Attention Network for Power Control in CFmMIMO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00967v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of such graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent \textit{empirical} studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel \textit{smoothness-generalization dilemma}, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in high-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise or sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants.

Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, thereby reducing the need to solve many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances.

| **[Adaptive Graph Mixture of Residual Experts: Unsupervised Learning on Diverse Graphs with Heterogeneous Specialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21207v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability. Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning, alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence on diverse graphs and tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baselines (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with more results</p></details> |
| **[On Transferring Transferability: Towards a Theory for Size Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23599v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details> | 75 pages, 10 figures |

Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/modelscope/facechain/tree/main/face_module/TopoFR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs. Our code is be available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph Data Selection for Domain Adaptation: A Model-Free Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17293v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem. Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA methods with much fewer training data.</p></details> |  |

The forward problem is numerically solved using the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference of Primordial Magnetic Field Parameters from CMB with Spherical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20795v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Structural and Semantic Signals in Text-Attributed Graphs with BiGTex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12474v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 27 figures |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines.

However, solving this mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems, which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns, achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization.</p></details> |  |

While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Yet, there are few known attempts to incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach successfully exploits.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional prefetching strategies are often limited by their reliance on predefined heuristics or simplified statistical models, which fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies in modern data access patterns. This paper introduces a modular framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and predict access patterns within graph-structured data, focusing on web navigation and hierarchical file systems. The toolchain consists of: a route mapper for extracting structural information, a graph constructor for creating graph representations, a walk session generator for simulating user behaviors, and a gnn prefetch module for training and inference. We provide a detailed conceptual analysis showing how GNN-based approaches can outperform conventional methods by learning intricate dependencies. This work offers both theoretical foundations and a practical, replicable pipeline for future research in graph-driven systems optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Distributional Invariance in Causal Subgraph for IRM-Free Graph Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20295v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing in Graph Neural Network for Chemical Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20236v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17 Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.</p></details> |  |

The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAMI: Taming Heterogeneity in Temporal Interactions for Temporal Graph Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23577v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction. Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective, especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs. To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB) datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings.

However, its accuracy often falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for future applications in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

Although several methods have been developed to enhance robustness, they rely on the unrealistic assumption that noise in node features is independent of the graph structure and node labels, thereby limiting their applicability. To this end, we introduce a more realistic noise scenario, dependency-aware noise on graphs (DANG), where noise in node features create a chain of noise dependencies that propagates to the graph structure and node labels. We propose a novel robust GNN, DA-GNN, which captures the causal relationships among variables in the data generating process (DGP) of DANG using variational inference. In addition, we present new benchmark datasets that simulate DANG in real-world applications, enabling more practical research on robust GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-GNN consistently outperforms existing baselines across various noise scenarios, including both DANG and conventional noise models commonly considered in this field.

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent.

Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08450v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables. v2: clarified over-squashing separation in light of related work</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25486v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, harnessing the full potential of data-driven machine learning has become one of the important thrusts. In addition to the advancement in wireless technology, it is important to efficiently use the resources available and meet the users' requirements. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for effectively modeling and extracting insights which inherently exhibit complex network structures due to its high performance and accuracy, scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. There is a lack of a comprehensive survey that focuses on the applications and advances GNN has made in the context of IoT and Next Generation (NextG) networks. To bridge that gap, this survey starts by providing a detailed description of GNN's terminologies, architecture, and the different types of GNNs. Then we provide a comprehensive survey of the advancements in applying GNNs for IoT from the perspective of data fusion and intrusion detection. Thereafter, we survey the impact GNN has made in improving spectrum awareness. Next, we provide a detailed account of how GNN has been leveraged for networking and tactical systems. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to learn more about GNN in the context of wireless networks, and understand its state-of-the-art use cases while contrasting to other machine learning approaches. Finally, we also discussed the challenges and wide range of future research directions to further motivate the use of GNN for IoT and NextG Networks.</p></details> |  |

The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |

Despite this momentum, the lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting, (ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance. Code is available at https://github.com/sybeam27/FnRGNN.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 main track</p></details> |
| **[An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node distinctiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from wound healing to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents, for the first time, a learning-based method to generate online spatial emergent concepts as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, reducing the need to handcraft both concept generation and the definition of their corresponding factors and covariances. In both simulated and real indoor scenarios, our approach improves complex concept detection by 20.7% and 5.3%, trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and map reconstruction by 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively, highlighting the benefits of this integration for robust and adaptive spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers, which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.</p></details> |  |

Yet, whether such long-range dependencies are essential remains unclear. We investigate if simple, domain-specific molecular fingerprints can capture peptide function without these assumptions. Atomic-level representation aims to provide richer information than purely sequence-based models and better efficiency than structural ones. Across 132 datasets, including LRGB and five other peptide benchmarks, models using count-based ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit fingerprints with LightGBM achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. Despite encoding only short-range molecular features, these models outperform GNNs and transformer-based approaches. Control experiments with sequence shuffling and amino acid counts confirm that fingerprints, though inherently local, suffice for robust peptide property prediction. Our results challenge the presumed necessity of long-range interaction modeling and highlight molecular fingerprints as efficient, interpretable, and computationally lightweight alternatives for peptide prediction.</p></details> |  |

Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple, explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating 20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data.

Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction. Ablation studies highlight the importance of road graph-structural features, amongst other features. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the analysis and develop a package for easily using our new dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages.

We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing well-established deep learning approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |

However, studies in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks (GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |

However, effective fashion recommendation demands precise service for each customer with a deeper cognition of fashion. In this paper, we conduct the first study on fashion cognitive learning, which is fashion recommendations conditioned on personal physical information. To this end, we propose a Fashion Cognitive Network (FCN) to learn the relationships among visual-semantic embedding of outfit composition and appearance features of individuals. FCN contains two submodules, namely outfit encoder and Multi-label Graph Neural Network (ML-GCN). The outfit encoder uses a convolutional layer to encode an outfit into an outfit embedding. The latter module learns label classifiers via stacked GCN. We conducted extensive experiments on the newly collected O4U dataset, and the results provide strong qualitative and quantitative evidence that our framework outperforms alternative methods.</p></details> |  |

Current evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments.

However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERO: Heterogeneous Continual Graph Learning via Meta-Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17458v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks have seen rapid progress in web applications such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, driven by the inherent heterogeneity of web data. However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v6)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies face a vast hypothesis space, while interventions such as gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. To accelerate such experiments, gene perturbation models predict the transcriptional outcome of interventions. Since constructing the training set is challenging, active learning is often employed in a "lab-in-the-loop" process. While this strategy makes training more targeted, it is substantially slower, as it fails to exploit the inherent parallelizability of Perturb-seq experiments. Here, we focus on graph neural network-based gene perturbation models and propose a subset selection method that, unlike active learning, selects the training perturbations in one shot. Our method chooses the interventions that maximize the propagation of the supervision signal to the model. The selection criterion is defined over the input knowledge graph and is optimized with submodular maximization, ensuring a near-optimal guarantee. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that, in addition to providing months of acceleration compared to active learning, the method improves the stability of perturbation choices while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy.</p></details> | 17 pages |
